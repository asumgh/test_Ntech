This kernel is InceptionV3 that written by Tensorflow. Web: https://keras.io/api/applications/inceptionv3/

Task: Binary classification of images of women and men

# 1. Preparing images for training.
For loading images and taking them to model I used ImageDataGenerator from keras.preprocessing.image: the generator was created so that we do not load RAM with images, we transform them right before uploading them to the network
Unusual parameters for training data generator: shear_range - counterclockwise shift angle in degrees, set to 0.2; zoom_range - the range for the random zoom, set to 0.2; horizontal_flip - randomly flip inputs horizontally. I used it to make flaxible model

# 2. Model.
I haven't chosen all of Inception V3 for this task
Parameters:
  * include_top=False : we don't need fully connected layer with 1000 outputs
  * weights='imagenet' : we need weights from ImageNet
  * new_output = keras.layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D()(model.output) : global pooling like in InceptionV3
  * new_output = keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')(new_output) : fully connected layer with 1 output

Summary of model you can check in file named "Model_summary.txt"

# 3. Results.

Validation accuracy of this model 0.9397035241127014
It means that in â‰ˆ94% of cases, the model works correctly
