# 1. Preparing images for training.
For loading images and taking them to model I used ImageDataGenerator from keras.preprocessing.image: the generator was created so that we do not load RAM with images, we transform them right before uploading them to the network
Unusual parameters for training data generator: shear_range - counterclockwise shift angle in degrees, set to 0.2; zoom_range - the range for the random zoom, set to 0.2; horizontal_flip - randomly flip inputs horizontally. I used it to make flaxible model

# 2. Model.
I haven't chosen all of Inception V3 for this task
Parameters:
  * include_top=False : we don't need fully connected layer with 1000 outputs
  * weights='imagenet' : we need weights from ImageNet
  * new_output = keras.layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D()(model.output) : global pooling like in InceptionV3
  * new_output = keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')(new_output) : fully connected layer with 1 output

Summary of model you can check in file named "Model_summary.txt"

# 3. Results.

Validation accuracy of this model 0.9397035241127014
It means that in â‰ˆ94% of cases the model works correctly

# 4. Instruction for training model.
You should:
1) Install neural_network.py, keras_utils.py, tqdm_utils.py
2) Install package: keras (with pip: pip install keras)
3) Install and unzip this https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-HUNDjcmSqdtMCvEkVlI0q43qlkcXBdK/view
4) Put all files in one directory
5) Uncomment all the scripts
6) Run neural_network.py, wait and grab coffie

# 5. Instruction for running model and make predictions.
You should:
1) Install pre trained model from this https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cVNz9MQpnw2X6ecds5L0SYSLMt923YU3/view?usp=sharing
2) Install process.py
3) Install packages: numpy (with pip: pip install numpy); pandas (with pip: pip install pandas); opencv-python (with pip: pip install opencv-python)
4) Put all files in one directory
5) Open your Command Line and go to the directory where you placed the files with command "cd name" (name-folders way)
6) Write "python process.py name_folder" where name_folder - folder in directory with images that need to be classified
Wait awhile...
After that you will find "process_results.json" with names and classes of each image
